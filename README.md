## Redux in a shopping cart page

##### this project aims to apply redux as a state manager in a shopping cart context, controlling the quantity of items and the total price of the cart.

##

##### the redux working architecture was built from scratch, with all the necessary functions to handle the page states.

##

##### And as this is a framework-agnostic library, the tools used were only HTML, CSS and JS. It can then be applied to any other project, regardless of the framework being used.
